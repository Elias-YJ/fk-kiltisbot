@Fk_kiltisbot is a direct communication channel to maintainers of the Guild room. Any feedback is appreciated whether is improvement suggestion or just notice that coffee has run out!

<b>Messages to Guild room committee</b>

You can contact Guild room committee by simply sending message to the bot. All messages will be answered. All relevant message types that Telegram supports are supported. Message will be anonymous unless you manually sign your message (in principle your telegram user id is saved to log files which could be used to figure out your identity but that is not something we would bother to do).
